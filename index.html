<h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

<p>
The Peninsula Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following semantics:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>RETAIN</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large scale. Technologies with a usage culture in our production environments, low risk and recommended to be widely used.</li>
<li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Nothing in the estate is best of breed so establish trial to find candidate</li>
<li><strong>RATIONLISE</strong> &mdash; Something known to be best of class adopt and seek economy of scale.</li>
</ul>

</td><td>

<h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support Product teams at Peninsula to pick the best technologies for new projects; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect on technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape. Based on the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a>, our Tech Radar sets out the changes in technologies that are interesting in software development &mdash; changes that we think our engineering teams should pay attention to and use in their projects.
</p>

<h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is maintained by our <em>Principal Engineers</em> &mdash; who facilitate and drive the technology selection discussions at Peninsula across the Engineering Community. Assignment of technologies to rings is the outcome of ring change proposals, which are discussed and voted on. The Tech Radar is open for contribution for all Engineering teams at Peninsula and depends on their active participation to share lessons learned, pitfalls, and contribute to good practices on using the technologies.<br/>
</p>

Check out our <a href="#">Engineering Blog</a> for more information on how we approach Technology Selection and use the Tech Radar at Peninsula.
